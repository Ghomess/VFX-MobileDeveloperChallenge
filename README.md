# VFX-MobileDeveloperChallenge by Tiago Gomes

Welcome to my VFX-MobileDeveloperChallenge! This app is built using React Native and serves to test my React Native skills to VFX Financial.

## Features

- Feature 1: Navigate between Screens using the bottom tab navigator.
- Feature 2: Type the stock in the search bar of the Story1 screen or type the currency pair in the search bar of the Story2 screen. (Nothing will appear as a result for now)

## Third-Party Libraries

Here's a list of third-party libraries used in this project and their purposes:

- **@react-navigation**: React Navigation is used for handling navigation within the app. It provides a flexible and customizable way to navigate between screens, a fast and effective way to add a stack navigatior, bottom tab navigator and a drawer navigatior. It's also one of the most used third-party libraries to handle navigation.

- **react-native-vector-icons**: This library is used for adding icons to the app. It provides a wide range of customizable icons that can be easily integrated into the app. It's used inside the bottom tab navigator and inside the search bar component.
